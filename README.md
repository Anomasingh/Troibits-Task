- Smooth, non-laggy behavior

✅ **Interactive Features**
- Click any feature in the list to select it
- Blue indicator shows active feature
- Navigation arrows (previous/next)
- Real-time updates in all three columns

✅ **Responsive Design**
- Mobile (375px): Single column layout

## 🎨 Design Features

### 1. Three-Column Layout

**Left Column (1/3)**
- Feature number and title
- Feature description points
- Previous/Next navigation arrows
- Updates on feature selection

**Center Column (1/3)**
- iPhone 14-style mockup
- Perfectly scaled to fit all screen sizes
- Shows mock UI of each feature
- Smooth fade transitions

**Right Column (1/3)**
- "Feature Showcase" header
- List of 5 features
- Blue indicator shows active feature
- Clickable to select features

### 2. Responsive Behavior

| Viewport | Layout | Changes |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Mobile (375px) | 1 Column | Content stacks vertically |
| Tablet (768px) | 3 Columns | Proper gap management |
| Desktop (1920px) | 3 Columns | Optimal spacing |

### 3. iPhone Mockup Sizing

| Device | Width | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| All sizes | max-w-xs (320px) | ✅ Fits perfectly |
| Border | 8px | ✅ Proportional |
| Notch | 96px wide | ✅ Realistic |
| Shadow | Subtle blur | ✅ Professional |

---

## 🔄 State Management

### Feature State
```typescript
const [currentFeature, setCurrentFeature] = useState(0)
```

### State Update Triggers
1. **Scroll**: In Section 2, wheel events cycle through features
2. **Click**: Clicking feature name in list sets active feature
3. **Arrow**: Clicking prev/next arrows changes feature

### Ref-Based Navigation
```typescript
const section2Ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
const section3Ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
```

Detects when user is in each section using `getBoundingClientRect()`

## ✨ Key Technical Implementations

### 1. Scroll Event Handling
```typescript
const handleWheel = (e: WheelEvent) => {
  // Detect if in Section 2
  if (isInSection2) {
    // Prevent default scroll behavior
    e.preventDefault()
    
    // Cycle through features
    if (isScrollingDown && !isAtLastFeature) {
      setCurrentFeature(prev => prev + 1)
    }
  }
}

window.addEventListener("wheel", handleWheel, { passive: false })
```

### 2. Framer Motion Animations
```typescript
<AnimatePresence mode="wait">
  <motion.div
    key={currentFeature}
    initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -30 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
  >
    <FeatureContent />
  </motion.div>
</AnimatePresence>
```

### 3. Responsive Grid System
```typescript
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 md:gap-6 lg:gap-8">
  {/* Automatically adapts to screen size */}
</div>
```

### 4. Active State Management
```typescript
{currentFeature === index && (
  <motion.div
    layoutId="activeIndicator"
    className="w-1.5 bg-blue-600"
  />
)}
```
