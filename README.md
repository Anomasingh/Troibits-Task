# Healthcare App Feature Showcase# Healthcare App Feature Showcase



A smooth scroll-driven website that walks you through 5 app features using an interactive iPhone mockup. Built for the Troibits internship task.A smooth scroll-driven website that walks you through 5 app features using an interactive iPhone mockup. Built for the Troibits internship task.



## What It Does### 🎯 Key Requirements Met



Scroll through the page and watch as 5 different healthcare app features come to life inside an iPhone. Each feature has its own custom UI that I designed - booking dashboards, AI insights, analytics graphs, payment tracking, and GST invoices.✅ **Section-Based Navigation**

- Section 1: Hero/Landing page

The website has three sections:- Section 2: Interactive feature showcase (Features 1-5)

1. **Intro page** - Landing section- Section 3: End/Call-to-action section

2. **Feature showcase** - The main part where scrolling switches between 5 features (600vh tall, so each feature gets plenty of scroll time)

3. **Outro page** - Ending section✅ **Scroll Behavior**

- Scroll through features without jumping to Section 3

The cool part: You stay on the feature section until you've seen all 5 features. No accidental jumps to the end.- Each scroll cycles to next feature (Feature 1→2→3→4→5)

- Only after Feature 5, scrolling takes you to Section 3

## Tech Stack- Smooth, non-laggy behavior



- **Next.js 16** with React 19✅ **Interactive Features**

- **TypeScript** for type safety- Click any feature in the list to select it

- **Tailwind CSS** for styling- Blue indicator shows active feature

- Native JavaScript for scroll handling (no GSAP)- Navigation arrows (previous/next)

- Real-time updates in all three columns

## How to Run

✅ **Responsive Design**

```bash- Mobile (375px): Single column layout

# Install dependencies- Tablet (768px): 3-column layout with proper scaling

pnpm install- Desktop (1920px+): Full 3-column layout

- iPhone mockup properly sized and never exceeds viewport

# Start dev server

pnpm dev✅ **Modern Stack**

```- React 19

- Next.js 16

Open http://localhost:3000 and scroll away!- TypeScript

- Tailwind CSS

## Features I Built- Framer Motion for animations



Each feature shows actual UI screens I created from scratch:---



1. **Smart Booking** - Dashboard with upcoming appointments and stats## 🏗️ Project Structure

2. **AI Suite** - Machine learning metrics and smart recommendations  

3. **Insights** - Line graph showing performance trends```

4. **Payments** - Transaction history with balance overviewcomponents/

5. **Billing** - Professional GST invoice with tax breakdown├── section-1.tsx          # Hero landing page with scroll indicator

├── section-2.tsx          # Feature showcase wrapper

## Layout├── section-3.tsx          # End section with CTA

├── feature-showcase.tsx   # 3-column grid layout (main component)

Three columns on desktop:├── feature-content.tsx    # Left column: Title, description, arrows

- **Left**: Feature descriptions with nav arrows (positioned at iPhone bottom)├── iphone-mockup.tsx      # Center column: iPhone device frame

- **Center**: iPhone mockup with volume/power buttons├── feature-list.tsx       # Right column: Feature selector

- **Right**: Feature list with blue indicator├── app-screen.tsx         # Phone UI for each of 5 features

└── ui/                    # Pre-built UI components

Everything stacks nicely on mobile.

lib/

## How Scroll Works├── features.ts            # Feature data and TypeScript interfaces

└── utils.ts               # Utility functions

The middle section (Feature showcase) is 600vh tall. As you scroll through it:

- 0-20%: Feature 1app/

- 20-40%: Feature 2  ├── page.tsx               # Main page with scroll logic and state management

- 40-60%: Feature 3├── layout.tsx             # App layout wrapper

- 60-80%: Feature 4├── globals.css            # Global styles

- 80-100%: Feature 5```



After 100%, you finally reach Section 3. Simple math, smooth experience.---



## What I Fixed Along the Way## 🎨 Design Features



- Section was unpinning too early (had to rework progress calculation)### 1. Three-Column Layout

- Navigation arrows were shifting with text (made them position:absolute)

- Feature 5 was getting skipped (adjusted thresholds)**Left Column (1/3)**

- Spent way too long debugging scroll behavior (but it works now!)- Feature number and title

- Feature description points

## Live Demo- Previous/Next navigation arrows

- Updates on feature selection

Check it out: [Troibits-Task on GitHub](https://github.com/Anomasingh/Troibits-Task)

**Center Column (1/3)**

---- iPhone 14-style mockup

- Perfectly scaled to fit all screen sizes

Made for the Troibits internship assignment. Took longer than expected but learned a ton about scroll-driven interfaces!- Shows mock UI of each feature

- Smooth fade transitions

**Right Column (1/3)**
- "Feature Showcase" header
- List of 5 features
- Blue indicator shows active feature
- Clickable to select features

### 2. Responsive Behavior

| Viewport | Layout | Changes |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Mobile (375px) | 1 Column | Content stacks vertically |
| Tablet (768px) | 3 Columns | Proper gap management |
| Desktop (1920px) | 3 Columns | Optimal spacing |

### 3. iPhone Mockup Sizing

| Device | Width | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| All sizes | max-w-xs (320px) | ✅ Fits perfectly |
| Border | 8px | ✅ Proportional |
| Notch | 96px wide | ✅ Realistic |
| Shadow | Subtle blur | ✅ Professional |

## 🔄 State Management

### Feature State
```typescript
const [currentFeature, setCurrentFeature] = useState(0)
```

### State Update Triggers
1. **Scroll**: In Section 2, wheel events cycle through features
2. **Click**: Clicking feature name in list sets active feature
3. **Arrow**: Clicking prev/next arrows changes feature

### Ref-Based Navigation
```typescript
const section2Ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
const section3Ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
```

Detects when user is in each section using `getBoundingClientRect()`

## ✨ Key Technical Implementations

### 1. Scroll Event Handling
```typescript
const handleWheel = (e: WheelEvent) => {
  // Detect if in Section 2
  if (isInSection2) {
    // Prevent default scroll behavior
    e.preventDefault()
    
    // Cycle through features
    if (isScrollingDown && !isAtLastFeature) {
      setCurrentFeature(prev => prev + 1)
    }
  }
}

window.addEventListener("wheel", handleWheel, { passive: false })
```

### 2. Framer Motion Animations
```typescript
<AnimatePresence mode="wait">
  <motion.div
    key={currentFeature}
    initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -30 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
  >
    <FeatureContent />
  </motion.div>
</AnimatePresence>
```

### 3. Responsive Grid System
```typescript
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 md:gap-6 lg:gap-8">
  {/* Automatically adapts to screen size */}
</div>
```

### 4. Active State Management
```typescript
{currentFeature === index && (
  <motion.div
    layoutId="activeIndicator"
    className="w-1.5 bg-blue-600"
  />
)}
```
